# Budget Allocation App

## Description

This project uses React to display a webpage to plan for budgeting expenses for various departments. 
- Can change currency using selector (will update in all areas of webpage) where it is displayed. 
- Can select an item, and add/reduce the number of items. This will update the webpage in the 'Quantity', 'Items Price' for the item and update the 'Cart Value'.
- Can remove all items from the Cart. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Tested on Windows 10
- Used NPM to install packages required to run server. Download at: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Tested on VSCode

### Installation
- Download Node.JS and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Download project from GitHub
- Open project folder in VSCode
- Open a new terminal (Terminal --> New Termainl)
- Ensure you are in the project folder
- Run the following command to install all the packages that are required for running the server (without start and end quotes):
  "npm install --s"

### Executing the Program
- Open project folder in VSCode
- Open a new terminal (Terminal --> New Termainl)
- Start the server using the below command in the terminal (without start and end quotes):
  "npm start"
- This will launch the website. You can do the following:
     - Change the currency in the 'Location' selector. This will update the currency symbol across the webpage.
     - In the 'Add Items' section you can select 'Items', then determine to add/reduce in the 'Quantity' selector and input a number in the text box. Click 'Save'
          - This will update the webpage in the 'Quantity', 'Items Price' for the item and update the 'Cart Value'.
     - Click the 'X' item in each row to clear quantity of the item down to 0. Cart Value will be updated accordingly. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
